# Vanguard Therapeutics: Strategic Overview
## Problem: The Cost of Pain
- Current Standard: Palladium-catalyzed synthesis (,000/oz).
- Risk: Heavy metal contamination and addiction liability.

## Solution: The Vanguard Protocol
- Innovation: Acridine-mediated photoredox catalysis (Nickel/Acridine).
- Cost Advantage: Reduce catalyst cost by 92% (Gupton Model).
-Safety: HSAB-tuned selectivity for non-addictive pathways.
